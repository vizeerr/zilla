  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">4.1 Nature of Services</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      PumpZilla serves as a decentralized-technology facilitator. While we provide a robust infrastructure for generating and transacting in Digital Assets, we do not function as a conventional broker-dealer, exchange, custodian, or financial institution. Our role is primarily to equip Users with the technological means to interact with various blockchains.

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">4.2 Independent Status</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      No fiduciary, agency, or partnership relationship is established between PumpZilla and you solely by virtue of your usage of the PumpZilla Platform. We operate independently, and nothing in these Terms shall be interpreted as forming a partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">4.3 Third-Party Services & Integrations</p>

      PumpZilla may incorporate or reference third-party services—such as external marketplaces, analytics services, or wallet providers—to enhance your overall experience. We do not endorse or guarantee any external platform’s safety, reliability, or performance. Your interactions with any linked third-party resources are governed by their respective policies and terms. We disclaim all liability arising from your use of such external services.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">4.4 Intellectual Property Overview</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      PumpZilla retains all rights, titles, and interests in the proprietary elements of our Platform, including (but not limited to) logos, trademarks, code, user interfaces, and software architecture.

<div className="my-8">
  <p className="mt-0 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">5. Risk Disclosure</p>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">5.1 Volatility & Speculative Nature</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      Digital Assets are inherently volatile and speculative. Their values can ascend or plunge precipitously over short periods, and external factors—including market sentiment, legislative changes, or technological updates—may cause extreme price movements. By using the PumpZilla Platform, you acknowledge that you understand the speculative nature of Digital Assets and assume the risk of potential financial losses.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">5.2 Regulatory Uncertainty</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      Rules governing digital currencies, blockchain tokens, and tokenized securities vary widely among jurisdictions and may evolve. Regulatory or legislative shifts could prohibit or severely limit your ability to trade certain Digital Assets, or impose new registration, taxation, or reporting requirements on your holdings or transactions. PumpZilla does not offer legal or regulatory advice, and it is your responsibility to remain informed about and comply with local regulations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">5.3 Technology Risks</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-0">
      <li>
        <span className="font-bold">Blockchain Vulnerabilities:</span> The underlying blockchain or smart contracts may contain code flaws, security vulnerabilities, or other glitches that could result in the partial or total loss of value or assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-bold">Transaction Finality:</span> Blockchain transactions, once executed, are typically irreversible. Erroneous transfers or mistakes in wallet addresses can lead to irretrievable losses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-bold">Cyber Threats:</span> Unauthorized access, phishing attacks, keylogging malware, and other forms of cyber intrusion pose constant risks in the Digital Asset space. You should maintain robust security measures, such as hardware wallets, two-factor authentication, and reliable antivirus protection.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">5.4 No Guaranteed Outcomes</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      PumpZilla does not endorse any particular Digital Asset nor guarantee any financial outcome or profit. Historical performance, market data, or “popularity” metrics should never be construed as promises of future returns.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-3">
    <p className="font-bold">5.5 User’s Due Diligence</p>
    <p className="mt-0">
      You must carefully evaluate your own risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence on any Digital Asset, project, or token in which you intend to invest, mint, or trade. Engaging qualified professionals (financial advisors, accountants, or lawyers) may be prudent, especially if you lack specialized knowledge of blockchain or crypto markets.

<div className="my-8">
  <p className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7. Transactions, Fees & Calculations</p>
  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.1 General Transaction Terms</span>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Scope of Transactions:</span> Transactions on the PumpZilla Platform may include creating new Digital Assets (minting), buying, selling, or transferring existing ones, and other functionalities (e.g., burning tokens, conducting auctions) as introduced by PumpZilla from time to time. Each transaction you initiate is subject to these Terms and any additional guidelines we may announce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Digital Asset-Specific Rules:</span> Certain Digital Assets may be governed by additional rules—such as special transfer restrictions, royalties, or smart contract requirements. By engaging with these assets, you agree to be bound by the relevant contract terms that apply to them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Transaction Irreversibility:</span> Blockchain transactions, once confirmed on the relevant network, are typically permanent and cannot be reversed by PumpZilla. It is your duty to verify all details—such as wallet addresses, amounts, and digital asset identifiers—before confirming a transaction.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.2 Calculations & Fee Schedules</span>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Fee Transparency:</span> PumpZilla charges a 1% transaction fee on each on-chain transaction facilitated through the PumpZilla Platform. This fee is separate from any blockchain network (“gas”) fees required by the underlying protocol. Additional charges—such as listing or minting fees—may also apply and will be clearly disclosed on the PumpZilla Platform. We strive to present fees in a transparent manner so you can anticipate all relevant costs before finalizing any transaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Dynamic Calculations:</span> Certain fees, such as network transaction (gas) fees, may fluctuate based on current blockchain conditions. We will display an estimated gas fee whenever feasible but cannot guarantee that the final cost will exactly match the estimate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Internal Methodology:</span> For any calculations we perform, PumpZilla’s internal records and logs are deemed final and binding, unless there is a documented manifest error that you bring to our attention.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.3 Adjusting Fees</span>
    <br />
    PumpZilla may revise its fee schedules over time to account for operational changes, regulatory developments, or new service offerings. We will notify you through appropriate channels when these adjustments take effect. Your continued use of the PumpZilla Platform following a fee revision signifies acceptance of the updated rates.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.4 Finality of Transactions & Records</span>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Final and Binding Ledger Entries:</span> Once a transaction has been broadcast on the blockchain and reflected in the PumpZilla Platform’s official transaction records, it is considered final in the absence of a proven technical or clerical error.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">Record Retention:</span> We may retain transaction data, digital receipts, and other logs for compliance, risk management, and auditing purposes for durations mandated by relevant legal or regulatory requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div className="my-8">
  <p className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">8. Instructions & Order Execution</p>
  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">8.1 Instruction Accuracy</span>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">User Responsibility:</span> You are solely responsible for ensuring that all instructions or commands submitted through the PumpZilla Platform are correct and complete. This includes verifying correct wallet addresses, correct blockchain networks, and accurate token identifiers or amounts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="font-semibold">No Duty to Verify:</span> PumpZilla is not obligated to investigate the legitimacy, accuracy, or completeness of any instruction. If we have reason to suspect fraud, unauthorized activity, or a clear typographical mistake, we may suspend or defer processing while seeking clarification, but this does not impose an affirmative duty on us to do so.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">8.2 Irrevocability of Orders</span>
    <br />
    Except as specified in these Terms or required by law, once you have submitted an instruction (such as an order to purchase or sell a Digital Asset), it becomes irrevocable. This principle reflects the immutable nature of blockchain transactions. If the underlying network confirms your transaction, PumpZilla generally cannot reverse or modify it.
