  PumpZilla typically operates as a “data controller,” meaning we determine why and how personal data is processed. In situations where we act as a joint controller or data processor on behalf of a third party, we will inform you of our role and responsibilities in that context. Our status as a data controller obliges us to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws and to implement safeguards that uphold your privacy rights.

  <br />
  Depending on your jurisdiction, local or regional regulations (for example, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the EU GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018, or equivalent legislation) may also apply. In such instances, PumpZilla takes reasonable measures to meet the obligations set forth in these regulations, including respecting your legal rights to access, correct, or erase data, as applicable.

    <span className="font-bold">6.3 Do Not Track Signals</span>
    <br />
    Our platform does not universally respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals due to the lack of a standardized industry approach. If you wish to limit tracking, we advise adjusting your browser settings or installing privacy-focused browser extensions.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">7. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Data</p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.1 Within PumpZilla and Affiliates</span>
    <br />
    We may share personal data with our subsidiaries, holding company, and affiliates for legitimate business operations consistent with the purposes described in this Notice. All parties are required to adhere to equivalent privacy obligations and security measures.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.2 Third-Party Service Providers</span>
    <br />
    We engage reputable third parties to offer services on our behalf (e.g., payment processors, web hosting providers, analytics vendors). These partners have access to personal data solely to the extent necessary to perform their assigned tasks and are contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.3 Business Transactions</span>
    <br />
    In the event of a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or similar transaction, personal data may be transferred to the successor entity. We will strive to ensure continuity of privacy obligations through contractual safeguards or, where necessary, seek your consent.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">7.4 Legal and Regulatory Compliance</span>
    <br />
    We may disclose personal data when compelled by law or where such disclosure is essential to protect our rights, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request from governmental or regulatory authorities. We may also share data to safeguard our interests in litigation or other disputes.
  </p>

</div>
<div className='my-8'>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">8. Data Retention and Deletion</p>

  <div className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">8.1 Retention Criteria</span>
    <br />
    PumpZilla retains personal data for as long as it is required to fulfill the objectives for which it was originally gathered. Factors influencing the retention duration include:
    <ul>
      <li>Regulatory Mandates: Certain laws prescribe minimum data-retention periods.</li>
      <li>Contractual Obligations: Data may be retained to fulfill obligations under user agreements or other contracts.</li>
      <li>Business Needs: We may store data for operational, audit, or security purposes, provided retention does not conflict with legal or privacy obligations.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">8.2 Deletion and Anonymization</span>
    <br />
    Once personal data is no longer necessary for any lawful purpose, we either securely delete it or anonymize it in a manner that prevents the possibility of re-identification. This ensures that residual data can no longer be associated with a particular individual. However, as noted, certain blockchain records cannot be modified or erased.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">8.3 Blockchain Considerations</span>
    <br />
    Data recorded on the Ethereum blockchain is, by design, immutable. We do not manage or control the Ethereum network, and thus cannot guarantee the removal or alteration of any on-chain records. Although we do our utmost to minimize personal data placed on-chain, certain metadata or transaction hashes may still lead to re-identification if combined with external information.
  </p>

</div>
<div className='my-8'>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">9. Data Security Measures</p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">9.1 Security Protocols</span>
    <br />
    We employ a range of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards intended to protect personal data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. These measures may include data encryption, secure server environments, firewalls, and periodic security assessments.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">9.2 User Responsibilities</span>
    <br />
    You also play a critical role in protecting your information. We urge you to utilize secure passwords, avoid reusing credentials, and enable any available multi-factor authentication. Inform us promptly if you suspect any unauthorized activity or if you detect any unusual transactions on the platform.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">9.3 No Absolute Guarantee</span>
    <br />
    Despite our commitment to strict security protocols, no data transmission or storage system is entirely foolproof. Any transmission of personal data is undertaken at your own risk. We disclaim liability for breaches that result from factors beyond our reasonable control (e.g., force majeure events, malicious third-party attacks).

    <span className="font-bold">10.1 Global Operations</span>
    <br />
    PumpZilla’s operations and infrastructure may span multiple jurisdictions, potentially involving cross-border transfers of personal data. This could mean your data is processed outside your country of residence.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">10.2 Adequate Safeguards</span>
    <br />
    Where required by applicable law, we rely on lawful mechanisms (such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, or other compliance frameworks) to ensure that transferred personal data receives an adequate level of protection.
  </p>

  <p className="mt-0 mb-3">
    <span className="font-bold">10.3 User Acknowledgment</span>
    <br />
    By using the Services, you acknowledge and consent (where legally permissible) to the transfer and processing of your personal data in jurisdictions that may not have equivalent data protection laws as your country of residence. We will continue to uphold robust security measures and only transfer data where it is lawful to do so.
